# multiple_features_task
In this task subjects choose between 4 slot machines located across the screen from left to right.
The "outcome-relevant" dimension is the machines' location, while all other (visual) features are outcome-irrelevant.
These visual features are cues which signal to participants which of the four bandits (machines) is currently available to choice.
The cues are geomatric shapes with different visual features (i.e., color, shape and texture).
This task was made by Romy Shufman and Maya Marcus as part of their Project in the lab as a part of Ido Ben-Artzi's PhD research.
